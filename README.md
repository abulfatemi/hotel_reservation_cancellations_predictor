# hotel_reservation_cancellations_predictor
Designed a project to predict hotel reservation cancellations using a neural network, acting as a binary classifier, involving leveraging historical data and various features related to reservations.
Data was collected from Kaggle website.
Features columns were divided into numerical and categorical columns.
To preprocess the data for predicting hotel reservation cancellations using a neural network, a structured pipeline can be implemented. This pipeline will involve several steps to ensure the data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared appropriately for training the model.Replaced missing values with  mean values for numerical features and  categorical features. Used OneHotEncoder to deal with categorical featires.
Developed a neural network with 'relu' as activation function and 'sigmoid' function.
Best validation accuracy was 84.2% and minimum validation loss was 0.348 was achieved
